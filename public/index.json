We reserve switchports for Bike manufacturing OT equipment, building security, printers, and some local NAS servers.\nWe mostly use cloud resources:\nAWS for developer resources.\nSalesforce acts as our CRM.\nOkta for our Identity Mangement Platform.\nWe use networking hardware from three different vendors and do not have a centralized dashboard to manage the hardware.\nFortiGate firewalls for routing and security\nCisco Catalyst 9200 switches\nUbiquiti WAPs\nBusiness and IT Requirements # Biketopolis does not have a centralized asset tracking platform for IT and OT equipment. We are considering a CAASM that can find and organize our assets, but also identify potential vulnerabilities.\nIT leadership is considering an MDM solution, but not all devices can accommodate an agent or management profile for full management. It would be nice to have an asset tracking system that can track our unmanaged devices.\nSome of our customers bring in their own network attached devices and we\u0026rsquo;re concerned that the devices use unsecure ports.\nWe would like a platform that can give us a topological view of our network.\nWe would like a UI that can give us an easy view of subnet utilization. We are currently using command line.\nMembers of IT and Operations leadership would like a centralized assurance platform to track assets and potential vulnerabilities.\nNeed this platform to be able to integrate with other cloud based services. Planning to migrate to Meraki to consolidate full networking stack to a single vendor.\nWe would like a solution with an open API that would allow our developers to make use of the gathered telemetry to be ingested by other 3rd party proprietary or analytics platforms.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"What We Do # We are a \u0026ldquo;Manufacturing as a Service\u0026rdquo; company that provides manufacturing centers for independent bike makers.","title":"About Us","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/guides/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Guides","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/runzero/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Runzero","type":"tags"},{"content":" How RunZero can help Biketopolis # RunZero begins with a Discovery Scan , which finds, identifies, and builds an inventory of all the connected devices and assets on your internal network. The runZero Explorer and scanner perform unauthenticated active scanning, which provides visibility into assets without the need to install an agent or managed profile.\nThe Inventory \u0026gt; Assets menu provides an easy to navigate through connected assets.\nThe Inventory \u0026gt; Services menu sorts assets by the Layer 4 ports being used. The Reports menu provides an Layer 2 Switch Topology view. The Integrate menu provides a list of service providers that RunZero partners with for integration. For example, you can integrate directly with AWS to identify workloads in your VPCs. RunZero even has an interactive index of API endpoints that can be used if data needs to be sent to a service provider app not available in the integrate menu.
